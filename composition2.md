I'm not like other girls. 

Now, I know what you're thinking: "that's what they all say." And I would agree with you, most girls say this at some point or another. But in this case, it really is true. I swear. Overall, if asked to describe myself in two words I would say, remarkably ordinary. Everything about me is terribly normal and basic, from my straight brown hair to the plain tshirt and jeans combo I wear everyday. Ten out of ten people, when polled, dubbed me an "average teen girl." Okay, there was no poll, but in my head that's how I imagine it would go. You'll just have to take my word for it. 

Anyway, I know this all contradicts my first statement and now you're thinking: "she's like all the other girls." But I'm not, I'm really not. Because you see, I have this thing, a ring. It's an old gaelic ring my grandma gave to me that her grandma gave to her, and before that her mother gave it to her, and her mother was the duchess of some town in Wales somewhere or something like that. I don't know all the details. The point is, it's a really old ring. 

In saying that I'm aware that all girls say this at some point or another, but this time it really is true. Trust me. For instance, do other girls have a magic gaelic ring that makes them temporarily invisible when they put it on their finger? I don't think so. Not a bad party trick, eh? 



After fifteen years of living on this planet, there are three things I can conclude, that I've recently discovered to be true. The first is  that despite what the movies may make you believe, rain is not automatically condusive of a romantic atmosphere. Secondly, girls with glossy purple "cool girl" hair should not, under any circumstances, be trusted. And finally, Warren Steele is a babe. That is all. 

But, I've gotten a bit ahead of myself. Obviously you don't want to hear about how faubulously normal and stable my life is now. No, no of course not. You want to dive deep into the mind of some hormone-controlled, insecure, gawky high school female who inevitably reacts horribly to the incidents in her daily life. The mind of one Molly Fletcher--that's me. Well, who am I to deny the people what they want? So, let's go back in time to when all the misfortunes started. 

It was a Tuesday.
