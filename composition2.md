I'm not like other girls. 

Now, I know what you're thinking: "that's what they all say." And I would agree with you, most girls say this at some point or another. But in this case, it really is true. I swear. Overall, if asked to describe myself in two words I would say, remarkably ordinary. Everything about me is terribly normal and basic, from my straight brown hair to the plain tshirt and jeans combo I wear everyday. Even my name, Molly, is grossly unoriginal. In fact, ten out of ten people, when polled, dubbed me "totally average." Okay, there was no poll. But, in my head that's how I imagine it would go. You'll just have to take my word for it. 

Anyway, I know this all contradicts my first statement and now you're thinking: "she is like all the other girls." But I'm not, I'm really not. Because you see, I have this ring. It's an old gaelic ring my grandma gave to me, that her grandma gave to her, and before that her mother gave it to her, and her mother was the duchess of some town in Wales somewhere or something like that. I don't know all the details. The point is, it's a really old ring. 

Unlike me, this ring is anything but ordinary. In fact, it's a magic ring. Have you ever seen The Lord of the Rings? Well, you know how when anyone puts on the ring of power the wearer instantly disappears from sight but then becomes visible to the creepy armour dudes and *the eye*? Okay, maybe you don't, but that's kind of like my ring, but way less intense. My ring, when I put it on my finger, temporarily makes me invisible. According to my grandmother this is some ancient gaelic magic that our ancestors used to protect themselves and spy on their enemies. She gave it to me this year, on my fifteenth birthday, as per tradition in the Fletcher family, and with it explained the history and the dangers of the magic. Basically, she told me it was only to be worn in emergencies and times of desperate need, and that I must never reveal to anyone its true capabilities. As you can imagine, these conditions were a total bummer. What's the point of having a magic invisibility ring if you can't use it or show it off? So much for a cool party trick. 

So, I don't wear the ring on my finger, obviously. Instead I wear it on a chain around my neck to keep it close in case of an emergency. But seeing as I'm a normal teen girl, as noted previously, admittedly there are many moments where I feel like I desperately need to disappear. And I've found that an invisibility ring really comes in handy in those moments. But, of course, like most things it has its downsides as well. In light of these downsides, and fifteen years of experience on this planet, I've recently concluded three things to be true. 

The first is that despite what movies may make you believe, rain is not automatically condusive of a romantic atmosphere. Secondly, girls with glossy purple "cool girl" hair should not, under any circumstances, be trusted. And finally, Warren Steele is a total babe. That is all. 

But, I've gotten a bit ahead of myself. Afterall, you don't want to listen to the boring details of how I'm wiser and learned from my experiences or whatever. No, no of course not. You want to deep dive into the mind of hormone-controlled, insecure, gawky high school female who inevitably reacts horribly to the incidents in her daily life. The mind of one Molly Fletcher--that's me. Well, who am I to deny the people what they want? So, let's go back in time to when all the misfortunes started. 

It was a Tuesday. 

The bell rang in the school signalling the end of lunch and the start of third period, gym class. I hate gym. Around me the other students started standing up from their seats, packing up thier lunch bags, and filing out of the cafeteria. A familiar routine. Orange lunch trays lay abandoned on the tables among scraps of food and empty chip bags. The lunch ladies, while packing away the food and cleaning up, gossip and complain about the ungratefulness of our generation. Their voices mingle with the clanging of metal serving trays and cutlery. The cafeteria is empty. I ball up some plastic wrap leftover from my sandwich, aim it at a trash can, shoot. It misses. The plastic wrap ball hits the floor and rolls away. And this is why I hate gym, I think to myself, standing up from the table and collecting my backpack. 

Gym is the purest representation of high school hierarchy and the tyranny of adolescence. It's a delicate operation. A performance. The way I see it, there are a few categories one might fall under in high school, which can be perfectly summarized in terms of gym class performance. First, there are the ones who excel at everything. Regardless of the sport, these guys and gals can jump over things, climb things, throw and catch whatever comes their way. Everything is easy and effortless for this group of people. Naturally, they are therfore the most popular bunch. The kids everyone wants to play with on the playground. The ones invited to all the birthday parties and backyard barbecues. You get it. Then there are the
