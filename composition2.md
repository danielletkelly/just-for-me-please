After fifteen years of living on this planet, there are three things I can conclude, that I've recently discovered to be true. The first is  that despite what the movies may make you believe, rain is not automatically condusive of a romantic atmosphere. Secondly, girls with glossy purple "cool girl" hair should not, under any circumstances, be trusted. And finally, Warren Steele is a babe. That is all. 

But, I've gotten a bit ahead of myself. Obviously you don't want to hear about how faubulously normal and stable my life is now. No, no of course not. You want to dive deep into the mind of some hormone-controlled, insecure, gawky high school female who inevitably reacts horribly to the incidents in her daily life. The mind of one Molly Fletcher--that's me. Well, who am I to deny the people what they want? So, let's go back in time to when all the misfortunes started. 

It was a Tuesday.
