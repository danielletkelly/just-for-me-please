I'm not like other girls. 

Now, I know what you're thinking: "that's what they all say." And I would agree with you, most girls say this at some point or another. But in this case, it really is true. I swear. Overall, if asked to describe myself in two words I would say, remarkably ordinary. Everything about me is terribly normal and basic, from my straight brown hair to the plain tshirt and jeans combo I wear everyday. Even my name, Molly, is grossly unoriginal. In fact, ten out of ten people, when polled, dubbed me "totally average." Okay, there was no poll. But, in my head that's how I imagine it would go. You'll just have to take my word for it. 

Anyway, I know this all contradicts my first statement and now you're thinking: "she is like all the other girls." But I'm not, I'm really not. Because you see, I have this ring. It's an old gaelic ring my grandma gave to me, that her grandma gave to her, and before that her mother gave it to her, and her mother was the duchess of some town in Wales somewhere or something like that. I don't know all the details. The point is, it's a really old ring. 

Unlike me, this ring is anything but ordinary. In fact, it's a magic ring. Have you ever seen The Lord of the Rings? Well, you know how when anyone puts on the ring of power the wearer instantly disappears from sight but then becomes visible to the creepy armour dudes and *the eye*? Okay, maybe you don't, but that's kind of like my ring, but way less intense. My ring, when I put it on my finger, temporarily makes me invisible. According to my grandmother this is some ancient gaelic magic that our ancestors used to protect themselves and spy on their enemies. She gave it to me this year, on my fifteenth birthday, as per tradition in the Fletcher family, and with it explained the history and the dangers of the magic. Basically, she told me it was only to be worn in emergencies and times of desperate need, and that I must never reveal to anyone its true capabilities. As you can imagine, these conditions were a total bummer. What's the point of having a magic invisibility ring if you can't use it or show it off? So much for a cool party trick. 

So, I don't wear the ring on my finger, obviously. Instead I wear it on a chain around my neck to keep it close in case of an emergency. But seeing as I'm a normal teen girl, as noted previously, admittedly there are many moments where I feel like I desperately need to disappear. And I've found that an invisibility ring really comes in handy in those moments. For instance, a week ago, when the unfortunate reality of being a teenager reached an all time high. 

It was a Tuesday. 

The bell rang in the school signalling the end of lunch and the start of third period, gym class. I hate gym. Around me the other students started standing up from their seats, packing up thier lunch bags, and filing out of the cafeteria. A familiar routine. Orange lunch trays lay abandoned on the tables among scraps of food and empty chip bags. The lunch ladies, while packing away the food and cleaning up, gossip and complain about the ungratefulness of our generation. Their voices mingle with the clanging of metal serving trays and cutlery. The cafeteria is empty. I ball up some plastic wrap leftover from my sandwich, aim it at a trash can, shoot. It misses. The plastic wrap ball hits the floor and rolls away. And this is why I hate gym, I think to myself, standing up from the table and collecting my backpack. 

Gym is the purest representation of high school hierarchy and the tyranny of adolescence. It's a delicate operation. A performance. The way I see it, there are a few categories one might fall under in high school, which can be perfectly summarized in terms of gym class performance. First, there are the ones who excel at everything. Regardless of the sport, these guys and gals can jump over things, climb things, throw and catch whatever comes their way. Everything is easy and effortless. Naturally, they are the most popular bunch. The kids everyone wants to play with on the playground. The ones invited to all the birthday parties and backyard barbecues. 

Then there are the jokers. This group isn't the best of the bunch but they're not the worst either. They can run and jump and throw and all that sporty stuff relatively well, but they always get picked first among the best of the best because they're *fun*. Making jokes and keeping everyone entertained, even the teacher. Everyone loves a good joker.

Finally, there are the truly unathletic individuals who possess no athletic ability and also lack the vibrant personality to make up for it. No one wants this person on their dodgeball team, or their kickball team, or whatever team. And they defintely don't receive an invite to the birthday parties. This is the way it is. Of course, there are people who fall between these categories and don't necessarily fit into just one, but this is generally how it works. Can you guess which category I fall under?

Walking down the hall towards the changing rooms I already know that I'm going to be late. The hallway, like the cafeteria, is completely empty. The hum of teachers beginning their lessons drifts under classroom doors. A locker decorated in purple wrapping paper disrupts the uniformity of the rows of blue lockers. The purple wrapping paper is peppered with stickers of pugs in various pug-like positions, laying on their backs, sitting up, tongues lolling out the side of their mouths. *Happy Birthday Erica* is scrawled across it in silver sharpie, with an assortment of scribbled notes and messages all around it. I pause a moment in front of the locker to read some of the messages. Erica is one of the "popular bunch." As I read I can hear a door open, a woosh of air, and the heavy sound of the door closing again. The squeak of sneakers on the glossy concrete floor.

"Molly!" I turn away from Erica's locker. There is my gym teacher, Mr. Kowolski, dressed head to toe in neon green nike apparel, arms crossed, wearing a stern expression that thoroughly contradicts his vibrant look. "What are you doing lingering in the halls? Class started ten minutes ago!" 

Upon closer inspection, I notice a small red splotch on the right side of his shirt's collar. Ketchup, perhaps? Hot sauce? The cafeteria served french fries today. As Mr. Kowolski's impatient look grows more intense I ponder whether he is the type of man to put hot sauce on french fries. An intriguing prospect. 

"Sorry," I mumble. "I got lost." A weak excuse, admittedly, although somewhat plausible seeing as I am technically still a new student. Having been at the school for almost a month though, it's maybe not that believable. By the look on Mr. Kowolski's face I can see he's not convinced. 

"Just go change and join us on the East field, we're playing rugby today."

I groan. Luckily, Mr. Kowolski ignores this, pivots in his squeaky shoes, and saunters down the hall and through the gym doors. 

In the changeroom I change relunctantly fast, folding my jeans and t-shirt before placing them on the top shelf of my gym locker. The smell in the air is unpleasant, a mix of body odour, floral deodorant, baby powder, feet, and wet grass. A continous dripping of water echoes throughout the room. A tap in one of the sinks is broken. I finish tying my shoes, stand up, and my hand instictively moves to the ring hanging from the chain around my neck. The silver of the ring gleams under the flurouscent bulbs, illuminating the delicate design. A heart in the middle wearing a crown, two hands coming together to the hold the heart.
