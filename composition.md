The Claddagh ring is a traditional Irish ring that originated in Galway and dates back to the 17th century. At least, that's what wikipedia tells me. The ring itself is composed of three key parts: the heart, the crown, and the two hands. Each part carries meaning. The heart signifies love; the crown, loyalty; and the two hands signify friendship. Traditionally, Claddagh rings were given as engagment rings, but have also become popular gifts from friend to friend, or for family members. 

My Claddagh ring was neither; not so much a gift, but rather a casual passing down of a family history. In fact, I am only one of many women in my family to own and wear this ring. Before me it was my mother's and she only gave it to me because it no longer fit any of her fingers and it conveniently fit mine. She recieved it as a gift from my aunt, my father's sister, Barb, who had it passed down to her by her mother, Elizabeth. 

When I look down at the ring now resting on my finger, I think of all the incredible, strong women who wore it before me. I think about the past and the history one tiny object carries with it. And most of all, I think about where it all started, in a small town in England when a young British man met a beauitful Irish woman at a dance and fell in love. 

This is a sotry I've heard many a times from my mother. Although it is a story about my paternal grandparents, when I was little my mother and grandpa would stay up late talking about his life and all the horrible and wonderful events that led him to Canada, and when he died, she would tell them to me. 

For all intents and purposes, this is a fairytale, with wicked step-parents, orphans, wishes, adventure, love, and a happily ever after. So in that vein, let me begin with the most cliche statement of all:

Once upon a time...
