The Claddagh ring is a traditional Irish ring that originated in Galway and dates back to the 17th century. At least, that's what wikipedia tells me. The ring itself is composed of three key parts: the heart, the crown, and the two hands. Each part carries meaning. The heart signifies love; the crown, loyalty; and the two hands signify friendship. Traditionally, Claddagh rings were given as engagment rings, but have also become popular gifts from friend to friend, or for family members. 

My Claddagh ring was neither; not so much a gift, but rather a casual passing down of a family history. In fact, I am only one of many women in my family to own and wear this ring. Before me it was my mother's and she only gave it to me because it no longer fit any of her fingers and it conveniently fit mine. She recieved it as a gift from my aunt, my father's sister, Barb, who had it passed down to her by her mother, Elizabeth. 

When I look down at the ring now resting on my finger, I think of all the incredible, strong women who wore it before me. I think about the past and the history one tiny object carries with it. And most of all, I think about where it all started, in a small town in England when a young British man met a beauitful Irish woman at a dance and fell in love. 

This is a sotry I've heard many times from my mother. Although it is a story about my paternal grandparents, when I was little my mother and grandpa would stay up late talking about his life and all the horrible and wonderful events that brought him to Canada, and when he died, she told them to me. 

For all intents and purposes, this is a fairytale, with wicked step-parents, orphans, wishes, adventure, love, and a happily ever after. So in that vein, let me begin with the most cliche statement of all:

Once upon a time...

The Kelly family, a family of six children, three girls and three boys, lived on a farm in Northern England with their mother and father. One day, without any just cause or explanation, the mother walked out on her family and never looked back. The father, a soldier in the Navy, couldn't stay to look after his children because he had to leave to fight in the war, so he sent his six children away to orphanages. The three girls were sent to one orphanage, while the three boys were sent to another, unsure if they would ever see each other again. The eldest child, just six-years-old, was Michael Kelly, my grandpa. 

Michael lived in the orphanage for sixteen years, over which time he received no love or nurturing from the nuns who ran the orphanage, and as the eldest son, carried the respsonsibility of looking after his two younger brothers. While at the orphanage his father visited only once and wrote letters when he could, but unfortunately was killed in the war. His mother never visited or wrote. On his sixteenth birthday Michael was allowed to leave the orphanage, and having nowhere else to go--and still loving his mother unconditionally as children often do--his mother allowed him to come live with her and her new husband, but only under the condition that he would work on the farm, for free. 

Although she wasn't his step-parent, Michael's mother was just as wicked and heartless as any other Disney fairytale villain. On top of working on the "family" farm for free day after day, his mother forced him to get another job to help pay the bills. But little did she know, Michael had bigger plans than simply staying and working on the farm like a slave for his mother. He dreamed of a fresh start in a new and exciting country far away from the one where he'd only known sorrow. So, with each payment from his outside work, he gave some to his mother and hid the rest in the toe of a boot under his bed, saving up for his escape. 

In the years that followed, Michael's life consisted only of hard work and little reward in the form of love or gratitiude from his mother. But his "boot savings" were growing significantly day by day and the dream of soon escaping his slave-like existence started to seem possible. This dream, unfortunately, was interrupted briefly when he was called to fight in the final years of WWII. 

But, things started to look up for Michael as he was lucky and survived the war unscathed, and although he had to return to the monotonous days on the farm and the cruelty of his mother, good fortune was awaiting just around the corner in the form of my grandma. 

Elizabeth Kerwick, or Betty as most people called her, grew up in Tipperary, Ireland in a big, but fairly normal family. However, like Michael's family, things in Betty's life took a turn for the worst when a family member walked out. This time it was the father and this time, there was an evil step-parent. Betty's new step-father came with new step-siblings, and like Cinderella, Betty was pushed aside and treated like a slave, rather than a member of the family. Imagine blankets on cold concrete floors and scraps of food served in a dog dish, and this was Betty's daily existence. The conditions were horrible and, like Michael, she wished to escape from it all. 

So, one day she did, and she fled to England.
