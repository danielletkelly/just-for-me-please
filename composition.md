The Claddagh ring is a traditional Irish ring that originated in Galway and dates back to the 17th century. At least, that's what wikipedia tells me. The ring itself is composed of three key parts: the heart, the crown, and the two hands. Each part carries meaning. The heart signifies love; the crown, loyalty; and the two hands signify friendship. Traditionally, Claddagh rings were given as engagment rings, but have also become popular gifts from friend to friend, or for family members. 

My Claddagh ring was neither; not so much a gift, but rather a casual passing down of a family history. In fact, I am only one of many women in my family to own and wear this ring. Before me it was my mother's and she only gave it to me because it no longer fit any of her fingers and it conveniently fit mine. She recieved it as a gift from my aunt, my father's sister, Barb, who had it passed down to her by her mother, Elizabeth. 

When I look down at the ring now resting on my finger, I think of all the incredible, strong women who wore it before me. I think about the past and the history one tiny object carries with it. And most of all, I think about where it all started, in a small town in England when a young British man met a beauitful Irish woman at a dance and fell in love. 

This is a sotry I've heard many times from my mother. Although it is a story about my paternal grandparents, when I was little my mother and grandpa would stay up late talking about his life and all the horrible and wonderful events that led him to Canada, and when he died, she would tell them to me. 

For all intents and purposes, this is a fairytale, with wicked step-parents, orphans, wishes, adventure, love, and a happily ever after. So in that vein, let me begin with the most cliche statement of all:

Once upon a time...

The Kelly family, a family of six children, three girls and three boys, lived on a farm in Northern England with their mother and father. When their father left to fight in the war, the mother, a weak and selfish woman, sent her six children away to orphanages because she felt they were too great a burden for her to bare on her own. The three girls were sent to one orphanage, while the three boys were sent to another, unsure if they would ever see each other again. The eldest child, just six-years-old, was Michael Kelly, my grandpa. 

Michael lived in the orphanage for sixteen years, over which time he received no love or nurturing from the nuns who ran the orphanage, and looked after his two younger brothers. While at the orphanage his father visited a handful of times when he was able and wrote letters when he couldn't, but unfortunately died in the war. His mother never visited or wrote. On his sixteenth birthday Michael was allowed to leave the orphanage, and having nowhere else to go, his mother allowed him to return to their home, but only under the conditions that he would work on the farm, for free. 

Although she wasn't his step-parent, Michael's mother was just as wicked and heartless as any other Disney fairytale villain. On top of working on the "family" farm for free day after day, his mother forced him to get another job to help pay the bills. But little did she know, Michael had bigger plans than simply staying and working on the farm like a slave for his mother. He dreamed of a fresh start in a new and exciting country far away from the one where he'd only known sorrow. So, with each payment from his outside work, he gave some to his mother and hid some in the toe of a boot under his bed, saving up money for his escape.
