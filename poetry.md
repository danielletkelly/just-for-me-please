1/4/2018 *This is the beginning of my 30 day "poem a day" April challenge!

2/4/2018 So, obviously didn't write a poem yesterday. In other words, I have literally already failed the challenge. But oh well, every day is a new start (as my mother would say). So I'm going to write a poem now. 

9/4/2018 Soooo I guess I'm failing miserably at this whole "a poem a day" challenge lol. Oops. In my defense, I have been busy. But to be fair, I am also just lazy and uninspired. For today's poem(s) I will maybe use a pinterest prompt.

**No Name**

He cried and I watched 

in silence

wondering what it would feel like 

to touch him

what his pain would feel like 

in my palm

the hand of the heartbreaker

the touch of the enemy

would he cringe and curl away 

into himself and his sorrow

like an animal

protecting itself from harm

from the predator threat

would he unravel like

a tulip broadening

in the glow of Spring sunshine

fresh and new 

and forgiving

or like a rope

untwisting from itself

until what remained was not rope 

just string

single strings frayed at the ends 

a sign of the whole it once belonged to

I wonder

tulip or rope?

But I never reached out

never touched him

as he sobbed in his bed

the one we once made love in

I just watched

and wondered 

and when he told me I should leave

I did

I left him there

like an animal or

a tulip or a rope

and closed the door behind me.

Happy
me
a poem about happy me
where does one even begin 
to find words 
that don't cause eyes to roll
and the choking gag at the back of the throat
cheesy
nauseating
Happy
that's not what the great poets did 
did they?
they gave us broody
moody heartbreaking poetry 
that hits you in the gut
and reminds you of the ex lover 
who grazed his lips across your cheek
and whispered your name in the dark 
the melancholy tragic nostalgia
addiction
we all crave

**Prompt: start poem with sentence from one book, and end with sentence from another book. 
-"Has it stopped raining?" and "They listened to each other"s breathing, as though the simple fact that they were both alive was all they had to share."

Has it stopped raining?

He asks between silent sips

apologetic gulps of water

run down his throat 

head tilted back 

adam's apple bobbing like

a buoy in the sea

or a bird resting on the surface 

a message in a bottle 

drifting toward land

carrying a message

he gulps and I wait 

for the parting of his lips

for the message in the bottle 

to curl out from his tongue 

like a scroll 

or a red carpet 

lavish and unnecessary

he speaks

and suddenly the rain 

the loudest thing between us

drowns us 

his words turn into raindrops 

and the room rises

all around us 

water and 

"I can't swim" I say

you open your mouth and

speak but all I hear is rain

rain and more rain

it hasn't stopped

I wonder if it ever will.

There is something tangible here
sand squished between toes
the cold metal of a doorknob
feather stuffed pillows
skin

and

The taste of you lingers
on the coarse taste buds of my tongue
the smell of your skin
on the nape of my neck 
where you kissed me
again and again

but

I can't seem to hold you steady
firmy in my fingertips 
you slip through 
like water
an ocean wild and free and escaping
you enchant me and entice me
further into your depths
I wade fearless and afraid
and trusting 
because you see
I've never been good at swimming
will you teach me?
will you make yourself into an ocean I can capture
embrace and float in?

I have a feeling
this real and tangible thing
inside me screaming 
like church bells
warning and alerting
this is going to change everything.
