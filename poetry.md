1/4/2018 *This is the beginning of my 30 day "poem a day" April challenge!

2/4/2018 So, obviously didn't write a poem yesterday. In other words, I have literally already failed the challenge. But oh well, every day is a new start (as my mother would say). So I'm going to write a poem now.

He cried and I watched 
in silence 
wondering what it would feel like 
to touch him 
what his pain would feel like 
in my palm 
the hand of the heartbreaker 
the touch of the enemy
would he cringe and curl away 
into himself and his sorrow
like an animal 
protecting itself from harm 
from the predator threat
would he unravel like 
a tulip broadening 
in the glow of Spring sunshine 
fresh and new and forgiving 
or like a rope 
untwisting from itself 
until what remained was not rope 
just string 
single strings broken at the ends 
a sign of the whole it once belonged to
I wonder 
tulip or rope?
But I never reached out 
never touched him
as he sobbed in his bed
the one we once made love in 
I just watched 
and wondered 
and when he told me I should leave 
I did
I left him there
like an animal or 
a tulip or a rope 
and closed the door behind me.
