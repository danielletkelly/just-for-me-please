1/4/2018 *This is the beginning of my 30 day "poem a day" April challenge!

2/4/2018 So, obviously didn't write a poem yesterday. In other words, I have literally already failed the challenge. But oh well, every day is a new start (as my mother would say). So I'm going to write a poem now.

**No Name**

He cried and I watched 

in silence

wondering what it would feel like 

to touch him

what his pain would feel like 

in my palm

the hand of the heartbreaker

the touch of the enemy

would he cringe and curl away 

into himself and his sorrow

like an animal

protecting itself from harm

from the predator threat

would he unravel like

a tulip broadening

in the glow of Spring sunshine

fresh and new 

and forgiving

or like a rope

untwisting from itself

until what remained was not rope 

just string

single strings frayed at the ends 

a sign of the whole it once belonged to

I wonder

tulip or rope?

But I never reached out

never touched him

as he sobbed in his bed

the one we once made love in

I just watched

and wondered 

and when he told me I should leave

I did

I left him there

like an animal or

a tulip or a rope

and closed the door behind me.

Happy
me
a poem about happy me
where does one even begin 
to find words 
that don't cause eyes to roll
and the choking gag at the back of the throat
cheesy
nauseating
Happy
that's not what the great poets did 
did they?
they gave us broody
moody heartbreaking poetry 
that hits you in the gut
and reminds you of the ex lover 
who grazed his lips across your cheek
and whispered your name in the dark 
the melancholy tragic nostalgia
addiction
we all crave

9/4/2018 Soooo I guess I'm failing miserably at this whole "a poem a day" challenge lol. Oops. In my defense, I have been busy. But to be fair, I am also just lazy and uninspired. For today's poem(s) I will maybe use a pinterest prompt.
